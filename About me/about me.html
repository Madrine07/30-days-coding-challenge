        <span>Hello! My name is Madrine Denla, and I’m a 21-year-old aspiring web developer with a deep passion for coding and everything tech.
         I’m currently pursuing a diploma in Computer Science at the Women’s Institute of Technology Uganda (WITU),
          where I’m honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in the world of IT. <br><br>
          From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by the power of technology and how it can transform the world. 
        Whether it’s building websites, developing applications, or exploring new coding languages, I love the problem-solving and creativity that comes with software development.
         My goal is to become a skilled and versatile web developer, but my ambitions don't end there—I'm excited to explore many other aspects of IT as my journey unfolds. <br><br>
        Above all, I am a child of God and a proud born-again believer. 
        My faith is a guiding force in both my personal and professional life,
         and I strive to reflect that in everything I do. <br><br>
        Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I look forward to connecting, learning,
         and growing as I continue on this exciting journey in the tech world. <br><br>

        Nice to meet you!</span>
